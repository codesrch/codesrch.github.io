MEASURING THE RELIABILITY OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ALGORITHMS (ICLR-2020)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This paper :cite:`rl_reliability_metrics` designed a set of matrics and statistics for evaluating the reliability of the reinforcement learning algorithms. It focuses on variability and risk, both during training and after learning (on a fixed policy). These metrics can be considered general-purpose and backed up by complementary statistical tests to enable rigorous comparisons on these metrics. In this paper, we first describe the desired properties of the metrics and their design, the aspects of reliability that they measure, and their applicability to different scenarios. We then describe the statistical tests and make additional practical recommendations for reporting results. The metrics and accompanying statistical tools is open-sourced at https://github.com/google-research/rl-reliability-metrics
