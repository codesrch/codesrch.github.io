Research Proposal
==================
-------------------------------------------------

Generalization remains one of the most fundamental challenges 
in reinforcement learning and agents often overfit to large 
training sets 
:cite:`zhang2018natural,cobbe2018quantifying,justesen2018illuminating,juliani2019obstacle`. 
An effective solution is to learn skill which can be used in various context of the environment.

In the tower of Hanoi paper, we showed how short-horizon skills can be leveraged in long-horizon tasks. 
The short-horizon skill learning environment is similar to the long-horizon task where the later has more 
objects, thus more challenging. The actions set is similar. In this work, we extend our skill learning 
approach to tackle different environments. We will demonstrate the skill transfer from one environment 
to the different environments. We will use the Progen OpenAI environment to demonstrate our algorithms. 
Progen consists of 16 different environments with different action sets and a diverse environment, thus challenging. 
We will develop an algorithm to demonstrate the generalization of reinforcement learning.
