Library and Tools
======================

Mlflow
	MLflow_ is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry. `Pytorch with mlflow`_ is an option.

.. _Pytorch with mlflow: https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pytorch.html

TensorBoard
	TensorBoard_ provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation: Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers) Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space Displaying images, text, and audio data Profiling TensorFlow programs.
	Tensorboard can be used `within Pytorch framework`_ too.
